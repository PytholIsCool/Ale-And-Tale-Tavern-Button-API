# The first ever button API for Ale and Tale Tavern!

## Features:
- Pages
- Tabs
- Panel Buttons
- Toggles
- Settings buttons
- Sliders
- Selectors
- Popups

**And more to come!**
### And best of all...
## All classes/objects are compatible with the main menu and the game!
(I know, crazy)
#  

### This API is fully functional and everything works as it would in-game 
### (given that the API is used properly)
# Give it a go!
